Development Philosophy
======================

Analsy is an open but opinionated tool, created by an open but opinionated developer.


Benevolent Dictator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Kevin Glisson`_ is the BDFL. He has final say in any decision related to Analys.

Values
~~~~~~

- Simplicity is always better than functionality.
- Listen to everyone, then disregard it.
- The API is all that matters. Everything else is secondary.
- Fit the 90% use-case. Ignore the nay-sayers.

Semantic Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many years, the open source community has been plagued with version number dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from project to project, they are practically meaningless.

Analys uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_. This specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your next project.
